Each sampled data point can be used to give us an equation that could be used to find what the parameters of a straight line passing through that point are. We only have 2 parameters, but will obtain 10 equations from our sampled points. This means that our system is overdetermined. The chance that 10 sampled points will fall on the same line is effectively zero unless they have been chosen to do so (and so are not in fact sampled), so there is no way to solve this exactly.\n",

Details of this algorithm can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm).
