## Day 4 and 5 of the Environmental Programming Bootcamp (Numerical Methods)
We will first begin by reviewing the use of functions in python, followed by 
a rewview of commonly used features and operations in the numpy and matplotlib packages. 
Then several (time permitting) numerical methods from the following list will be covered, 
where for each method we implement a function for the methodology and then demonstrate
how to use the scipy equivalent function.

### Numerical Method topics: 
* Root finding
* Systems of equations
* Interpolation
* Integration
* Matrix Diagonalization
* Fitting and Optimization

**Topics with materials but not covered**
* FFT
* Differential Equations
* Machine Learning

## Contents
This folder contains the following items with descriptions: 
* run_ipython.sh    --  script for launching the notebook server
* master.ipynb      --  the top level jupyter notebook containing outline of topics
                        covered with links to all other notebooks
* Review_Material   --  folder with notebooks and subfolders of review material for 
                        functions in python, the numpy package and the matplotlib 
                        package
* Numerical_Methods --  folder containing notebooks and subfolders of the numerical
                        methods covered. 

## Instructions for using the materials

You should have cloned this git repo on the midway compute cluster. If you have not
first log into midway and clone this repo in your home folder. Then run the ipython
notebook server launch script from your terminal: 
```
./run_ipython.sh
```
Paste the URL with token that is displayed in the terminal into your web browser to 
connect to the notebook server.

Once in the folders view of your notebook server, click on the main.ipynb notebook to open it.
