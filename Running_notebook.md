To start a Jupyter notebook on Midway2, please do the following steps:
1. Open a browser and go to https://midway2.rcc.uchicago.edu
2. Login using your CNetID and password
3. Once logged in, from top left corner, please select Applications->System Tools->Terminal
4. On the terminal window, type `cd env_bootcamp/`
     * I assume you have run `git clone https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/env_bootcamp.git` previously to 
  create the `env_bootcamp` folder in your home directory
5. Go to the `env_bootcamp` folder  
5. Run the `git pull` command in the `env_bootcamp` folder
6. Run `cd Day4-5`
7. On the terminal, type `sh /project2/env_bootcamp/scripts/run_ipython.sh`
     * after waiting for few seconds, you will see an address like 
  http://128.135.112.69:16664/?token=87cb97894e54269def89acfe40ea48aa6c1beef0af1b08cb Copy and paste it to your browser's
  address bar on your laptop and you should be able to run the bootcamp notebooks.
  
  Please see [here](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/docs/connecting/index.html#connecting-with-thinlinc) for more information
